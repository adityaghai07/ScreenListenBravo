# FastAPI CSV Company Classifier

This project is a simple FastAPI backend that processes a user-uploaded CSV file containing company records. It uses a OpenAI /Language Learning Model (LLM) API to classify companies as technology companies based on their descriptions and stores the results in a relational database.

## Features

- **CSV Upload**: Accepts a CSV file containing company records with a "Description" column.
- **LLM Integration**: Connects to an LLM API to determine if a company is a technology company.
- **Database Storage**: Creates a new table/uses existing table with postgres instance on Render with the CSV data and an additional "Technology Company" column.
- **Docker Support**: Fully containerized using Docker for easy deployment.
- **Dependency Management**: Managed with Poetry for consistent environments.
